## I Have a Question

The guide for submitting a **question**. If you follow this guide, you help our maintainers and the community to answer your question as fast as possible. Or you can answer a question if you like, that would be suuuper helpful. ü•≥

### Before you ask a question

Read the documentation. Both for the [plugin](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) and [Cloudinary in general](https://cloudinary.com/documentation).
Look through existing questions both on the [plugin's discussion board](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/discussions) and in the [Cloudinary Community](https://community.cloudinary.com/).

#### How Do I Submit a Good Question?

- Start a [discussion](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/discussions) in the repo for plugin-specific questions or start a thread in the [Cloudinary Community](https://community.cloudinary.com/) for other Cloudinary questions.
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** to identify your question.
- **Describe your question** including as many details as you can.
- Include **screenshots and/or animated GIFs** if you can.

### Reporting Bugs

The guide for submitting a **bug report**.If you follow this guide, you help our maintainers and the community to understand the problem and come up with a fix.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Use the [latest version](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/releases).
- Reread the [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) and review your plugin configuration to make sure it's correct.
- Check the [bug tracker](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues?q=label%3Abug) and see if somebody has already reported your bug or error.
  - If so, commenting on the existing issue is better than opening a new issue

Jump to ["I Have a Question"](#i-have-a-question) if you need help or support.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We track bug reports as [Github issues](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/issues).

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues/new).
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** to identify the bug.
- Describe **step-by-step** how to reproduce the bug. Include as many details as you can. Don't just say what you did, but explain **how** you did it.
- Describe the **current behavior** and explain the **behavior you expected instead** and why.
- If possible **provide an example** to reproduce the bug. Include links to files, GitHub projects, or include copy/pasteable snippets.
  - If you provide code snippets, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
- Include **screenshots and/or animated GIFs** if you can.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do _NOT_ include your Cloudinary API Secret or other sensitive information.

### Suggesting Enhancements

The guide for submitting an enhancement suggestion, both **new features and minor improvement ideas**. If you follow this guide, you help our maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and follow up on it.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Use the [latest version](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/releases) of the plugin.
- Reread the [readme](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md). Maybe your idea is already possible with a different configuration?
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues) and see if someone has already suggested your idea. If so, commenting on the existing issue is better than opening a new issue

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

We track enhancement ideas as [Github issues](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues).

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues/new).
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** to identify your idea.
- Describe **your idea** including as many details as you can.
- Describe the **current behavior** and explain the **behavior you would like instead** and why.
- Include **screenshots and/or animated GIFs** if you can.

### Your Code Contribution

The guide for submitting your **code contribution**. If you follow this guide, you increase the chance of getting your code released.

If you are new to open-source code contributions, start with these links:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.Github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Using pull requests when collaborating](https://docs.Github.com/en/Github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

Unsure where you can best start contributing code? Look through these ["good first issues"](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue").

#### Before You Start Contributing

- Add a comment to an existing [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues), indicating your interest,
- or create a new [issue](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/issues/new), describing what you'd like to contribute.

In both cases, outline your action plan and wait for feedback before spending too much time coding your solution in case your action plan is not within the scope/goals of this plugin.

#### Fork, Clone, and Install

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/fork)
2. Clone the fork to your local machine: `git clone /git@Github.com:<username>/gatsby-plugin-starter.git`
3. Move into the repository folder: `cd gatsby-plugin-starter`
4. Install packages: `yarn install`

##### A note on Yarn Workspaces

The project uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), hosting the plugin and demo code in one repository. You may manually test your changes while developing because the included demo will use the code in the plugin workspace (not the one published to the NPM registry).

Install in the correct workspace by including `workspace plugin` or `workspace demo` in the command. Example: `yarn workspace plugin add lodash`.

> Be careful when publishing packages in a workspace. If you are preparing your next release and you use a new dependency, but forgot to declare it in the package.json file, your tests might still pass locally if another package already downloaded that dependency into the workspace root. However, it will be broken for consumers that pull it from a registry, since the dependency list is now incomplete so they have no way to download the new dependency. Currently, this scenario will not let you throw a warning.
> <cite>[Yarn Workspaces Docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)</cite>

#### Develop

- Create a new branch and use the issue number when naming your branch: `git checkout -b -<issue number>-<something descriptive>`.
- Commit your changes often: `git commit -a -m <your message>`.

‚ú® Remember to update the demo and add tests when relevant. ‚ú®

You'll find the plugin code in the `plugin` folder and the demo code in the `demo` folder.

- `yarn develop` runs the demo
- `yarn watch` run the tests in watch mode

Your local repository folder's root is where you run both scripts.

#### Pull Request

Before making a Pull Request, make sure you:

- Run `yarn test` and **no tests fail**.
- Update the **readme** describing your contribution.
- The files have the **right format** run `yarn format`.

Then you may:

- Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/compare).
  - Select `base repository: cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary` > `base: main`
  - and `head repository: <your fork>` > `compare: <your branch>`
- Write your title and description following the **[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard.
  - If unsure, use a clear title, and a maintainer will help you follow the conventional commit standard

‚ÑπÔ∏è We will squash all your commits into one with the Pull Request title and description as the commit message, so do not worry about every single commit message being perfect.

A maintainer will review your Pull Request in the style of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/).

- If changes are requested, make those changes.

When a maintainer accepts and merges your Pull Request, a new version of the plugin is [auto-released](#release-process).

### Improving The Documentation

There are two main documentation files:

- The project [README.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) = "How to use the plugin"
- The project [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) = "How to contribute to the plugin" = this text

Improvements to both are very much encouraged üôè

You may follow the guide for [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution) or make changes directly from Github.

- [Edit the README.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/blob/main/README.md) directly on Github
- [Edit the CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cloudinary-devs/gatsby-transformer-cloudinary/edit/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (this text) directly on Github

&nbsp;

## Release Process

Our plugin use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to automate releases by using the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/).
